RESPONSIVE MENUS
----------------
Responsify your menus! Just give me a CSS or jQuery style selector 
of your menu and I will make it mobile friendly (when the time is right).

CONFIGURATION
-------------
For many use cases, the default settings will be enough.  Turn it on = done.
I am a huge fan of 0-config, too many things to configure in Drupal already.
That said, there are plenty of configuration options at:
/admin/config/user-interface/responsive_menus

Alternatively, you can use Responsive Menus as a Context reaction with all
the same options.

These options include:
-CSS/jQuery selectors for which menus to responsify
-Text or HTML to use as the menu toggle button
-Responsive menu style (currently 'Simple' or 'Mean Menu' options)
-Screen width to respond to
-Remove other classes/id's when responded
